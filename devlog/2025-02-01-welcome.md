"The Waifu Believes in You" Theory - It's a meme-infused idea that suggests programmers with anime waifu PFPs (Profile Pictures) perform better because they believe their waifu is "watching over them" and cheering them on. It's mostly a joke, but I believe there's a kernel of truth wrapped in the meme.

Before I begin, I want to give credit to the article that inspired me to jump into this rabbit hole - [Does Having an Anime Profile Picture Make You a Better Programmer?](https://medium.com/@jackiexu1228/does-the-waifu-believes-in-you-theory-apply-to-programmers-cb63f4db3a9e)

## The Investigation

As an avid anime enjoyer and someone with multiple favorite anime characters of my own, I naturally became curious to see if this theory holds true. To solve this mystery, obviously, I asked ChatGPT.

*hm… ok… I am not satisfied with the answer*

I don't know why, but I had an urge to figure this out by myself.

First, I had to decide what would consider someone a better programmer. Then I came across the LeetCode global ranking site. It represents your position relative to other users based on your performance in contests and problem-solving activity. I decided to see how many people in the LeetCode ranking use anime PFPs.

## The Method

They have a public GraphQL endpoint available for everyone to use. I decided to scrape this page and gather all the top 2000 rankers' profile pictures. Surprisingly, it only came out to be ~63mb of data.

Next, I had to figure out how to categorize these profile pictures. My first consideration was Google's Vision AI API. However, I faced a significant challenge with this API - it costs money, roughly $2 per 1,000 images. This means I would have to spend a total of $4 to classify anime profile pictures for 2,000 images.

As an alternative, I decided to opt for open-source AI projects available on GitHub. One of the most popular free vision AI models is YOLOv5. Luckily, there is already a model trained to detect anime faces called **YOLOv5_anime**.

We just gotta feed these PFPs to the detection model. Now we just have to run the script and wait.

*Roughly takes 5 sec per image to be categorized*

## Results

So now I've got 2000 LeetCode profiles categorized into Anime PFP and Normal PFP. I used Jupyter Notebook and Pandas to generate tables. Here are the results:

**Top 2000 users:**
- 19% of top 2000 users are using Anime PFP

**Top 1000 users:**
- 19.9% of top 1000 users are using Anime PFP

**Top 500 users:**
- 20% of top 500 users are using Anime PFP

**Top 100 users:**
- 15% of top 100 users are using Anime PFP

**Trend Analysis:**
The trend line indicates that more users are using Anime PFPs as the ranking goes up. Users ranked between 300 ~ 400 have the highest Anime PFP ratio - 26%.

The results suggest a clear trend: the higher the LeetCode rank, the more likely they are to use an anime profile picture (PFP) as their avatar.

## Thoughts & Conclusion

There are multiple theories as to why programmers with anime profile pictures (PFPs) seem to outperform those with regular ones. One possible explanation lies in the constant exposure to their chosen Anime PFP. Every time they open Slack or any site, they see their own waifu. They lock eyes with their waifu, who silently reassures them, "I believe in you." This motivation pushes them to work harder, unlocking potential they never knew they had. It's this drive that propels them past their original goals.

However, raw problem-solving ability isn't the only factor that defines a great programmer. Many crucial aspects of software development - such as communication skills, project planning, system architecture, and other intangible qualities - cannot be accurately measured by a LeetCode ranking alone. The longer I stay in the industry, the clearer it becomes that these soft skills are often more valuable than pure technical prowess.

That said, this article was never meant to prove anything definitively. It was more of a curiosity project than a serious analysis, without any deeper implications. After all, as the saying goes: **Correlation does not imply causation.** 🙂
